<h4 id="connectWorship">Worship</h4>
<p>
Whether you want to sit in the back of the pews or lead the worship, we have a place for you to find your spiritual home! We highly value your presence - no pressure, no requirements. 
If you want to participate more in the church, then we have more than enough space for you to express your spirituality in Christ either through music, worship leadership, media service, or any other gifts that you could share. 
</p>

<h4 id="connectDisciple">Discipleship</h4>
<p>
Our small group meetings are intentional communities that seriously cater to the spiritual needs of the members during the week. We believe in small groups as "church within a church" model in which members of the church meet weekly to discuss about the Scripture, talk about life matters, and build relationships.
We also have informal gatherings for activities and table fellowship. We like to have fun and eat out! So, join us for laughter, food, and fun conversations happening all throughout the year. 
</p>

<h4 id="connectShare">Sharing</h4>
<p>
Aletheia ministries strive to care locally and globally through Christ's love.
